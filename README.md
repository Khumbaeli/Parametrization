# Parametrization of a Sphere's Radius 

This program finds the volume of a sphere through the parametrization of regular cartesian coordiantes into the spherical coordinates with the radius. This is expressed through the following triple integral:

$$
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^\pi\int_0^1 \rho^2\sin\theta\;\mathrm{d}r\mathrm{d}\theta\mathrm{d}\phi.
$$
